# Downloading and Using the CLI
Currently, Redownload is only available with a CLI (command line interface).
Instructions for downloading it and using it are as follows:
- Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/Morpheus636/redownload/releases) page in this repository.
- Select the most recent stable release (or alpha/beta, but you may have problems with them).
- Download the file starting with `redownload-cli` for your operating system.
## Linux
- Open a terminal
- `cd` into the directory containing the `redownload-cli-linux` file
- run `chmod +x ./redownload-cli-linux`
- you can now run the file with `./redownload-cli-linux <archive.org OR relisten.net link>`. This will download all the .mp3's and .flac's
to `./redownloads/`
- if you need more options, you can run `./redownload-cli-linux --help` and it will print the help to the console.

## MacOS
- Open a terminal
- `cd` into the directory containing the `redownload-cli-mac` file.
- run `chmod +x ./redownload-cli-mac`
- you can now run the file with `./redownload-cli-mac <archive.org OR relisten.net link>`. This will download all the .mp3's and .flac's
to `./redownloads/`
- if you need more options, you can run `./redownload-cli-linux --help` and it will print the help to the console.

## Windows
- Open cmd.exe
- `cd` into the directory containing the `redownload-cli-windows.exe` file.
- run the file with `redownload-cli-windows <archive.org OR relisten.net link`. This will download all the .mp3's and .flac's
to a subdirectory of your working directory called `redownloads`
- if you need more options, you can run `./redownload-cli-windows --help` and it will print the help to the console.
